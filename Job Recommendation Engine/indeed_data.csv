So if you’re ready to work on unrivaled technology where your desire to be part of a collaborative team is met with a laser-focused mission to stop breaches and protect people globally, let’s talk.
About the Role
The CrowdStrike Malware Research Center is the core of Falcon’s malware detection and response capabilities. The team has a focus on understanding the threat landscape and sets the target for what Falcon should be identifying and preventing. Additionally, the MRC is responsible for understanding our capabilities, and mapping how well our machine learning and behavioral protection capabilities are doing against those threats. Where there is a gap, the MRC takes action to improve our detection stance, and improve our overall protection story. There are many parts of CrowdStrike working towards protecting customer environments, and the MRC works across all of them to ensure we are on target and providing the best protection for our current threat landscape.
Threat Research Team
Leading the charge for understanding the activity of malware today is the Threat Research team. With a focus on malware research, the primary role of the team is to understand relevant threats and techniques used in malware that is threatening our customer’s business. The challenge is the enormous scale of malware today and sheer number of samples required to be addressed. This takes a more creative approach than traditional Anti-Virus research, focusing on one sample at a time. The modern threat lab requires an economy of scale through automation and machine learning to allow people to focus on new learnings, and let systems continue to identify malware based on what the team has learned.
Manager, Threat Research
With a challenging role comes the requirement for a skilled manager with a background in threat research and reverse engineering.
Leading a team of threat researchers requires solid people managing skills for helping grow the team and supporting them in being successful in the organization.
Additionally, the team’s manager must have a solid understanding of the technical requirements of the positions reporting to them in order to provide proper guidance and help grow the team’s technical skills.
Requirements
The technical Manager position in CrowdStrike is not defined as a progression from an individual contributor. It is a unique career path focusing on excellence in supporting the business through scaling out their technical expertise while also focusing on supporting a team of candidates from new college hires to senior engineers.
There is minimal hands on threat research in the role, but the expectation of having the background and prior experience with the role is required.
This is a career track where you transition from your individual contributor role to being a leader and mentor to the organization, providing guidance, understanding business requirements, and helping your team achieve success in those requirements.
Solid interpersonal skills are a must, along with a strong sense of empathy, to help guide employees through understanding where they are in their career and technical path.
A proven background in advanced reverse engineering on file-based threats is required.
Additional reverse engineering around file-less threats, exploits, and other attach techniques are desirable to be demonstrated at a moderate skill level.
A good working knowledge of malware based automation workflows and techniques is required.
Efficiency of the team is important and can only be achieved in today’s malware environment through a high degree of automation.
The Threat Research team is supported by an engineering team, but proof of concept automation is produced by researchers. Showing competence handing off research to engineering to produce results is required.
Bachelors or Masters in Computer Science or comparable field required.
8+ year’s experience in the threat research field with a focus on malware analysis required.
Strong interpersonal communications skills required, with the ability to demonstrate leadership and team building expertise required.

This is a senior Software Development Engineer (SDE) role in the engineering team that delivers the sensor (lightweight agent) on Linux. SDE’s in the team own design and development of core features on the platform. Features will cross-cut most core OS subsystems such as file system, memory, process, and networking. Many features are also built in a way that they will have shared components across Windows and Mac. The team operates under the Agile development principles and ships frequently.
Responsibilities
Design and develop Linux software for deployment on server
Own features from design to delivery
Collaborate with multi-functional team in various physical locations
Troubleshoot issues with the product as reported from customers responsively

An artificial intelligence programmer helps develop operating software that can be used for robots, artificial intelligence programs or other artificial intelligence applications. They may work closely with electrical engineers or robotics engineers and others in order to produce systems that utilize artificial intelligence. This refers to the capability of adapting or changing based on adding data. It may also mean programming a system to look for or seek out specific conditions and respond based on those factors. For example, their programming may enable robots to learn to interact with other robots or work together collaboratively. Other systems they program may be designed to take specific actions only under certain conditions.
Artificial intelligence programmers specialize in developing the software for robots and systems. Many people experience the results of the work of artificial intelligence programmers every day through search engine results. They can help search engines make conclusions about the information a person is really looking for even if they've made spelling mistakes. Artificial intelligence programmers also work on things like video games, facial recognition software and military weapons.
Required Education
Artificial intelligence programmers must have a bachelor's degree to pursue entry-level work in their field. Common fields of study include computer science, artificial intelligence, robotics and engineering. Artificial intelligence programmers should acquire training and experience with programming languages, such as Java and LISP. Related studies in psychology and philosophy are also recommended.
Required Skills
Artificial intelligence programmers have to perform calculations and need to have good mathematical skills to do so. They also need computer skills so that they can design and develop relevant software. Communication skills are important for artificial intelligence programmers because they must be able to clarify their objectives to others in their team, and they may be responsible for supervising other programmers as part of their duties.
